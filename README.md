Power-A
=======

Linux Power Management Tool
There are many top level software available in market for Windows system but as per for Linux based system there are not so good PM software available. Those which are available are unable to perform as per userâ€™s need.

Power A is PM software for Linux based Laptop system. It controls the overall power usage of Laptop and gives exact information about battery status and system. It also gives user a flexible way to kill the unused process.

I have used the following tools into accomplish the project.

C programming. GCCCompiler GTK+ library for graphics interface. Udev and sysfs kernel. X11 GIMP
